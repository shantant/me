## ⚙️ The Core Technologies: Pillars of Our Architecture

This project is built upon a duality of technology—a synthesis of low-level power for maximum performance and the flexibility of the web stack for a dynamic interface.

| Component | Technology (Percentage) | Contribution and Philosophy |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **🚀 CORE ENGINE** | **C (50%)** | **The Primary Pillar of Performance:** The C language was chosen as the computational heart of the project. Its dominant contribution ensures **raw speed**, **high-level memory efficiency**, and the capability to run core logic with minimal overhead. It is the engine driving everything. |
| **🌐 PRESENTATION** | **HTML5 (17%)** | **Structural Framework:** Serves as the foundation for clean and semantic markup. It is used to construct the entire content structure of the user interface using modern standards. |
| **💅 STYLING MODULE** | **SCSS/Sass (16%)** | **Elegant Style Architecture:** Employed for modularized and well-managed styling. SCSS allows the use of variables, nesting, and mixins to create a consistent, maintainable, and scalable design. |
| **⚡ INTERACTIVITY** | **JavaScript (6%)** | **The Dynamic Layer:** Although its percentage is small, JavaScript is fully responsible for client-side interactivity. It is used to bring UI elements to life, process dynamic data, and deliver an intuitive user experience. |

### 💡 Architectural Philosophy

We believe in a clear separation between **Processing Power (C)** and **User Experience (The Web Stack)**. This approach ensures that the project is not only **fast and efficient** behind the scenes but also **intuitive and responsive** in front of the user.
